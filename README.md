How to run:

**Method 1: Godot Debug**

1. Download Godot 4.4
2. Clone repository and open it in Godot
3. Press Run Project/F5 (in top right, looks like menu)

**Method 2: Run Binaries**

1. Clone repo
2. See ./bin/ for Linux and Windows binaries. Unfortuntaly, exporting to Mac required a lot of overhead that we could not figure out, and neither of us own Macs as well.
