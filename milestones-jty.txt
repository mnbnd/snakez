Camera (5 pts)
 - make sure it follows player, doesn't look awkward during high octane gameplay
 - implement script for springarm to make movements smooth and not rigid
 
Snake Body (5 pts)
 - make sure snake model grows when it should
 - slither effect
 - only head of snake should turn initially, body then follows

3d modeling - Blender (5 pts)
 - make 3d models for food, snake head/body, level
 - Need to learn blender first however. Spend time on tutorials trying to get to the point where it is feasable
 - make other color snakes for other players, default is green
 - add eyes to snake and make them move either in funny way or somewhat seriously
 - overall goal is to make things visually appealing- take in input from john
 
Basic AI (10 pts)
 - have CPU snake move randomly to begin with, but good enough not to suicide every time
 - completely unsure how to begin programming this at this stage, but just have something down
 - This will make or break how fun the game actually is to play during demo day, so I have deemed this to be the most important task
 
 Menu Design (5 pts)
 - have a functional and visually appealing menu
 - Use photoshop/Illustrator to create cool text logo for Snakez. Something basic but flashy enough
 
 Basic Level Design (5 pts)
 - decide on whether we want to just do a grid level or not. Even if yes, make the grid somewhat interesting looking and not just a quadratic plane
 - Split level into tiles so food can spawn
 - This portion should not be too difficult to implement both design wise and code wise
 
 Sound Design (5 pts)
 - Things like slither sounds, death sounds, menu click sounds. Not music
 - Planning on pulling from royalty free soundbanks, but could get creative myself
 
 Local Multiplayer (EXTRA CREDIT)
 - No clue how hard this is, but I imagine it would be quite the task if we were to decide to implement this
 - Research this and come to conclusion with John on what we want to do
